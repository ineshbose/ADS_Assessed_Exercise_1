# Assessed Exercise
The exercise has three parts. The first for implementing four variants of quicksort algorithm in Java, the second involves running empirical studies to compare the performance of each version and the third involves the definition and implementation in Java of an algorithm to compute adversaries for quicksort.

## Part 1
Implement the following algorithms in Java
* The pseudocode for QUICKSORT inclluding procedure PARTITION implementing right-most element pivot selection.
* A variant of QUICKSORT which returns without sorting subarrays with fewer than k elements and then uses INSERTION-SORT to sort the entire nearly-sorted array
* A variant of QUICKSORT using the median-of-three partitioning scheme
* 3-WAY-QUICKSORT

## Part 2
Compare all four versions of the algorithms implemented in **Part 1**. Use the datasets (.txt files) provided. Also compare with the running times of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort. Report and explain the findings.

## Part 3
Define an algorithm to generate pathological input sequences for the quicksort algorithm, that is instances that will require quadratic time to be sorted. Consider a median-of-three partitioning scheme (left, middle, right). It is assumed duplicates are not allowed in the input array. Explain in the report how the algorithm operates and implement it in Java.

## Grading
This exercise counts for 10% of the total assessment mark for the course. It is worth a total of 30 points.
Part 1 has four parts for 6, 2, 2 and 10 marks respectively. Part 2 is worth 4 marks and Part 3 is worth 6.
