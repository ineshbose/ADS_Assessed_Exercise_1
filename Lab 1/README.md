# Lab 1

## Task 1
1. Implement the `InsertionSort` algorithm in Java.
2. Write a test program, `TestSortingAlgorithms` to check that the implementation is correct, namely that the output array is in _ascending order_.
3. Implement `InsertionSortDescending` to sort arrays in _descending order_.

## Task 2
Implement `SelectionSort` algorithm in Java. Use `TestSortingAlgorithms` to check that the implementation is correct.

## Task 3
A suite of test text files have been provided containing _n_ integers in randomly sorted order. Write a program `TimeSortingAlgorithms.java` to generate timing runs for `InsertionSort` and `SelectionSort` outputting the time taken to sort each of the text files. The output should be something like:

```
-------------------------------------------------------
Time taken to sort int10.txt:

InsertionSort: 310 milliseconds

SelectionSort: 530 milliseconds


-------------------------------------------------------
Time taken to sort int50.txt:
(etc.)
```
