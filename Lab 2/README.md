# Lab 2

## Task 1
1. Implement in Java the pseudocode for `FACT`.
2. Implement in Java `fact-tail`, a tail recursive version of `FACT`.
3. Implement in Java `fact-iter`, an iterative version of `FACT`.

## Task 2
1. Implement in Java the pseudocode for `FIB`.
2. Write a tail recursive version of the algorithm using linear recursion. The algorithm should have O(_n_) complexity.

## Task 3
1. Implement in Java the pseudocode for `MergeSort`.
2. Implement a variant of `MergeSort` which uses `InsertionSort` to sort small instances.
3. Rewrite the `Merge` procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array L or R has had all its elements copied back to A and then copying the remainder of the other array back into A.
4. Implement bottom-up `MergeSort`.
5. Compare all different versions of the algorithm using `TimeSortingAlgorithms` implemented in **Lab 1**. Use the same text files.
